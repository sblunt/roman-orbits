Include "raw" data here-- i.e. files grabbed directly from papers, vizier, etc.
We should also include scripts here that read all of these files, concatenate them,
and make files that are readable by the orbit-fitting codes we want to use. The idea
is to reduce "hand-copying" of data (which tends to introduce mistakes) as much 
as possible.
